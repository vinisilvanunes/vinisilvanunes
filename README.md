## 🎯 Career Goals
I am focused on improving my skills in backend development, specifically in Java and Spring Boot. Additionally, I want to expand my expertise in frontend development, especially with Angular, as I aim to build full-stack applications.

## 👨🏽‍💻 About Me
I have a strong passion for backend development and love solving complex problems. I believe in writing clean, efficient code, and I'm always looking for ways to optimize systems and workflows. While frontend development is something I enjoy, UI/UX design is not my strongest suit—but I always give my best effort to ensure the UI is functional and visually appealing. When I'm not coding, I enjoy practicing and watching sports (I play soccer and basketball, and watch soccer, basketball, Formula 1, and UFC), watching movies (especially horror), playing video games (fighting, racing, and shooting games), fixing electronics, and exploring new technologies.
